## About Me
My first exposure to programming was in college with two of my roommates who were studying computer science. The times I did hear about it from them were when they struggled with assignments or had classmates over for study groups before a midterm. It was interesting to hear about, but it wasn't on my radar as I was busy enough with my studio courses in architecture.

As time went on, it started to appear more and more, from using some Python to do parametric modeling in an architecture course to designing app UIs in another and trying to implement them with basic CSS.

With each exposure, I both enjoyed the process and further understood the frustration I had witnessed my roommates deal with when something simple didn’t work for reasons beyond my understanding.

Ultimately, I like making things, both physical and digital. Currently, I’m focusing more on digital as it addresses some of the gripes I had with architecture, and it just draws me in more at the moment.
